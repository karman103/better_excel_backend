Output exactly one JSON object and nothing else.\n\nGoal:\nGiven a natural-language question about a CSV and only minimal context (column names + the first three raw lines),
\nproduce a SINGLE Python 're' compatible regex that:\n1) Matches the relevant CSV line(s), and\n2) Captures the requested cell value in ONE named group (?P<value>...).
\n\nConstraints:\n- Engine: Python 're' ONLY (no \\K, no atomic groups, no variable-length lookbehind).\n- Prefer literal tokens present in the question (e.g., exact keys like 
dates or ids).\n- If a specific row key is present (e.g., a date), anchor with ^KEY, at line start.\n- Cells may be quoted or unquoted; a tolerant cell atom is allowed: 
(?:\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\"|[^,]*)\n- For quoted-or-not values, capture with optional quotes: \\\"?(?P<value>[^\\\",]+)\\\"?\n- Return JSON in this exact form: 
{\"regex\":\"YOUR_PATTERN\"}
